## 1. Bioinformatics Processing and Quantification
### Trimming with TrimGalore
Raw reads were quality trimmed using TrimGalore v0.4.2 with flags -q 24, --clip_R1 12, --clip_R2 12, --length 50, and --stringency 5. 

## Mapping with STAR
Trimmed reads were mapped to the brown bear reference genome assembly22 (NCBI GCA_023065955.2) using STAR v2.7.6a 23, retaining only uniquely mapping reads using â€“ outFilterMultimapNmax 1 . 

## Quantifying gene-level read counts with featureCounts
Gene-level read counts were then quantified using featureCounts from Subread v1.6.3
